h1. This Repository has little use.

 Amazon's "console":http://aws.amazon.com/console/ now supports SES and has every feature this app does.
 This app is only useful if you're looking to embed it as rack middleware in another app.

h3. SESChange is a Sinatra app to monitor your SES account activity.

  "Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)":http://aws.amazon.com/ses/ is a way for your application to send transactional email cheaply.
  Amazon puts "funky restrictions":http://aws.amazon.com/ses/faqs/#31 on your initial send rate and transaction limits.

h3. If you want to know where you stand, without resorting to the command line - best get yourself a'SESChange.

h3. Features

  * Heads up of your current sending limit and sending rate.
  * Heads up and graphs of Delivery Attempts, Bounces, Rejects and Complaints
  * List of "Verified" email addresses

h3. Coming up (hopefully)

  * Nicer presentation
  * Ability to run as rack middleware with simple http auth
